		// engine.Use() - there's no per-route override for it in this
		// framework version). It must be at least as large as the longest
		// any single request is allowed to legitimately take.
		//
		// That's now POST /images and POST /images/{id}/retry: both process
		// every requested size synchronously, inline in the handler (see
		// ImageController.Store, services.ProcessImageRequestSync), and
		// don't respond until that finishes - however long it takes for
		// however many sizes were requested. IMPORTANT: this middleware
		// also fully buffers every response and only releases it to the
		// client once the handler returns OR this deadline fires - if the
		// deadline fires first, the buffered response (the finished
		// result, however much processing succeeded) is silently
		// discarded, not delivered, even though the request row itself
		// still gets its final status recorded (the handler keeps running
		// in its own goroutine past that point - see
		// services.SweepStaleProcessingRequests). So this value isn't
		// "extra safety margin", it's the actual ceiling on how long a
		// client can wait for a real answer. Set generously (default 5
		// minutes) since processing time can vary a lot with requested
		// size/count and this app is meant to just wait it out - raise it
		// further if you regularly submit many large sizes per request.
